In this assignment you will create a program that is capable of identifying a minimum spanning tree of an undirected, weighted graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.

Your program will take as a command line argument the name of a file that contains the specification for an undirected, weighted graph, G. The file will have the following format:
The first line will be an integer, N, that represents the number of nodes in the graph. You can assume the nodes are labeled with the values [0,N-1].
The next N lines will represent the rows of the adjacency matrix, with each line consisting of N weights, represented as doubles.

You should process the file and create a weighted graph representation using the WGraph class we implemented together in class. Once the WGraph is created, your program should compute the MST for the graph using Kruskal’s algorithm. This should be done by adding a method to WGraph, computeMST(), that works as follows:
Identifies a MST for the graph. Note that a given graph may contain several MSTs, but you only need to identify one.
Displays the cost of the MST (the sum of all the edges in the MST) to standard output
Displays the adjacency matrix representation of the MST (a NxN matrix where all edges are 0 except for the edges that make up the MST) to standard output

Note that you may create any additional classes you need to support your implementation (eg. a priority queue for to use for Kruskal’s algorithm), but at a minimum your solution should contain the following files:
main.cpp
WGraph.h
WGraph.cpp
